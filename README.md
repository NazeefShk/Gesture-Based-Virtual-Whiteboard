# Gesture-Based-Virtual-Whiteboard
Gesture-Based Virtual Whiteboard is a real-time computer vision application that allows users to draw and interact with a digital canvas using hand gestures captured through a webcam. Built using MediaPipe and OpenCV, the system supports color selection, drawing, erasing, and screen clearing without any physical input devices.
